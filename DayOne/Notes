🌐 What is Kubernetes (K8s)?
Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications (e.g., apps running in Docker containers) across clusters of servers.

🧠 Why was Kubernetes created?
Containers (like Docker) are great for packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit. But when you have to:
-- Run hundreds or thousands of containers
-- Spread them across multiple servers
-- Ensure high availability, scaling, updates, and fault tolerance
it becomes very complex to manage manually.

Kubernetes solves this complexity.

🧩 Core Concepts in Kubernetes
1. Cluster
-- A Kubernetes cluster is a set of machines (nodes) that run containerized applications.
-- Master Node (Control Plane): Manages the cluster.
Worker Nodes: Run the application containers.
 
2. Pod 
-- The smallest deployable unit in K8s.
-- A Pod can hold one or more containers that share storage, network, and lifecycle.
-- Containers in the same pod can communicate with each other easily.

3. Node
-- A node is a single machine (physical or virtual) in the cluster.
-- It can run multiple pods.

4. Deployment
-- Manages the desired state of your app (e.g., 3 replicas of a pod).
-- Ensures the app is always running as specified.
 
5. Service
-- A permanent IP and DNS name that abstracts a group of pods. 
-- Helps other apps/services to communicate with your pods even when pods are recreated or rescheduled.
 
6. Volume
-- Used to store data persistently (survives pod restarts).
-- Many types: emptyDir, hostPath, nfs, persistentVolumeClaim, etc.


🛠 Kubernetes Use With Docker
-- Kubernetes uses Docker containers (or others like containerd) to run apps.
-- But it manages them across nodes using controllers, schedulers, and APIs.
